## Pull Request Procedures

Please follow these procedures while working on the Roundware Server code base and creating new
pull requests:

* Never create commits in the develop branch. Always use feature branches.
* Write clear concise commit messages stating *why* the change is being made.
* Keep commits organized into separate logical code change groups.
* Rebase your feature branches against the current develop branch before creating a pull request.
* Rebase your feature branches to squash all irrelevant commits.
* Close Github issues [via commit messages]
(https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
* Write unit tests for new features.
* Preferred branch naming method: [Issue Number]/[Short Description]
* Follow the [PEP8 - Style Guide for Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) whenever
  possible/reasonable.
* Automate upgrade procedures whenever possible. Add upgrade procedure notes to UPGRADING.md in
  reverse chronological order.
* Document important changes in CHANGELOG.txt; use past tense phrases in reverse chronological
  order.
* New contributors, please add your name/info to AUTHORS.txt.

## Git/Github Development Workflow
Creating your local repository clone after forking on Github:
```bash
# Clone your Roundware Server fork repository
git clone git@github.com:<username>/roundware-server.git
cd roundware-server
# Add the primary Roundware Server repository as a remote called: upstream.
git remote add upstream https://github.com/roundware/roundware-server.git
```

Updating the `develop` branch in your local repository clone:
```bash
# Checkout the origin/develop branch.
git checkout develop
# Pull down the upstream/develop branch changes.
git pull upstream
# Push the changes to your origin/develop branch.
git push origin
```

Rebasing your `1/feature-name` branch verses the `develop` branch after updating:
```bash
# Switch to your feature branch.
git checkout 1/feature-name
# Rebase your new commits vs the existing commits.
git rebase develop
# Force update your feature branch with new commit history.
git push origin 1/feature-name --force
```
